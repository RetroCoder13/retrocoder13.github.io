        <p>I'm an indie game developer.<br><br>I started creating games in Python but now I'm creating them in JavaScript so more people can play it.<br>All my games are in JavaScript apart from Control Bonds which was for the GMTK Game Jam 2021 that I made in Python.<br>My latest game is Hidden Helper which I made for the GMTK Game Jam 2023<br><br>I also team up with Shrudders and Zaperno for some of my projects!</p>
