My website is hosted using GitHub pages and is coded in HTML and JavaScript<br><br>

## How does HTML work?
HTML stands for "Hyper-Text Markup Language" which means it uses tags rather than code
```HTML
<p>This is text</p>
```
Displays:<br>
This is text<br><br>
This piece of code displays text on the screen. `<p>` displays a paragraph.<br><br><br><br>
```HTML
<a href="retrocoder13.github.io">Click me!</a>
```
Displays:<br>
[Click me!](https://retrocoder13.github.io)<br><br>
This displays a clickable link on the screen. The `<a>` tag is an anchor which creates a clickable link that redirects you to places<br><br><br><br>
```HTML
<title>Website</title>
```
This tag doesn't display anything but in the tab list, this sets what the title of the page is.
