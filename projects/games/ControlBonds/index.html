    <p id="fade">Submission for GMTK Game Jam 2021<br>Me and my friend Daniel decided to take part in the GMTK Game Jam 2021.<br>It was our first time doing a Game Jam and the first one we did together.<br>The theme was "Joined Together" so our idea was that you are joined to your controls (WASD).<br>YOur controls is an object on screen that moves twice as fast as the player,<br>if a key goes off screen, you can't use that key to move.<br>Daniel designed 5 levels based on this idea and I coded it all<br>Check out the results for how well we did <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2021/rate/1082027">here</a></p>
